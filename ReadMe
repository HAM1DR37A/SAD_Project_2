Hi

This is readMe file that will explain about our project.

this is the structure which shows the format of project ::

our_project/
    manage.py
    our_project/
        __init__.py
        settings.py
        urls.py
        wsgi.py
    app1/
        __init__.py
        admin.py
        migrations/
            __init__.py
        models.py
        tests.py
        views.py
    app2/
        __init__.py
        admin.py
        migrations/
            __init__.py
        models.py
        tests.py
        views.py
    so on :)

for creating your app folder use command bellow where manage.py is ...
>python manage.py startapp <your app name>
then you can work on your app without concerning about confliction that may occur later ;)

for building other's DB use command bellow:
>python manage.py makemigrations <app name>
>python manage.py migrate
